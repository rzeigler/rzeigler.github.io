My name is Ryan Zeigler and I live a little bit north of Washington, D.C. in the USA. I'm a Software Engineer by trade and you can learn more about my professional career at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-zeigler-58272216/)

With S5 (and for most of my career), I mostly deal with web applications and distributed systems in a corporate environment. 

I enjoy tennis, cycling, computer games, tinkering with electronics, and hiking with my family.
